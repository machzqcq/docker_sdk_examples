# docker_sdk_examples
While I spent a great deal of time using docker client and creating a [course](https://github.com/machzqcq/docker-for-all),
I felt the need to be able to achieve the same through code, hence this repo.

# Why

- Maybe I want to build an app that will programmatically do what I can do from command line using docker-client
- I like to understand how applications built on top of docker ecosystem like - Rancher, docker ui etc. work internally
- Be able to contribute back to the source code, but can do that only first if I know what is present and in-progress
- Because IaaC (infrastructure as code) is cool ;)

# How
I started with docker sdk for python, however intend to use multiple languages
